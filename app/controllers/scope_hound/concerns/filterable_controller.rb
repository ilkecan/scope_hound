# This module provides an interface for attaching easy filtering capabilities to a controller.
# It acts as a base for models to interact with their controllers. When included in a model,
# it allows the controller to accept a specific set of filter parameters which are then processed
# and applied on the model's data for tailored querying and data selection.
# This is particularly useful when you want to have the flexibility of filtering
# model data directly from controller parameters.
